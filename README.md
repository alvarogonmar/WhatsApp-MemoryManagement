# WhatsappMessages.cpp

This project demonstrates a simple simulation of WhatsApp chat message management using C++ and the two-pointer technique.

## Description

- The program generates a chat history with a specified number of messages.
- Every 17th message is marked as deleted (simulating message deletion in a chat app).

## How it works

1. **Message Generation:**
   - The `generateChatHistory` function creates a vector of messages, marking every 17th message as deleted.

## Key Concepts

- Two-pointer technique
- In-place array/vector modification
- Simulating message deletion and compaction
